This framework has been designed to make the development of resource oriented web services easier.

The general concept is to create a new folder in the resources directory, one for each conceptual chunk of content (a user resource, a blog post resource, a comment resource)
Each resource contains a set of routes, a set of models, and a collection of views.

You should then make one master resource, (I name it after the site I'm working on) which is configured to depend on all the other resources you need.
Routing requests through the master resource will automatically check all child resources if the master fails.

If you wish to use views, you need to create a node_modules folder and put the mu.js library within it.

todo: 
serious performance testing
more use cases to determine what is needed in real world development
access resources via routes
caching strategy
session strategy (should it be models?)
single instance of resources, treat like a node module (if not already handled that way)
smart way to fork based on accept headers, or some other field so that you can use one code base for api's and front ends.
the ability to include in a template a routed request. fill a subview with a json decoded response of routing a fake request.
have a web based platform that uses lots of the same code styles, so that the subviews could be in view or in browser
clean up code after the major prototypical rewrite
investigate testing alternatives, or just clean up own framework bit by bit.
