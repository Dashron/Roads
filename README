This readme, some resources and some components are now out of date. Look at /resources/example/example.desc.js for a basic idea on how resources work (you can now call resource functions within a route via 'this')


-----------------

This framework has been designed to make the development of resource oriented web services easier.

The general concept is to create a new folder in the resources directory, one for each conceptual chunk of content (a user resource, a blog post resource, a comment resource)
Each resource contains a set of routes and a set of models.

You should then make one master resource, (I name it after the site I'm working on) which is configured to depend on all the other resources you need.
Routing requests through the master resource will automatically check all child resources if the master fails.
router_catch_all is an optimization that is checked before any routes are attempted. If router_catch_all does not match, no routes within that resource will be checked.
